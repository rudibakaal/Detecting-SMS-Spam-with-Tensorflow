# Detecting-SMS-Spam-with-Tensorflow

## Motivation
A neural network trained on SMS messages designed to classify SMS spam. 

The SMS Spam Collection is a public set of 5,574 SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research [1].

The algorithm was able to learn the message vocabulary and idf, then return the term-document matrix through the sklearn TfidfVectorizer class. The binary label was one hot encoded with the sklearn LabelEncoder class. 

## Neural Network Topology and Results Summary

The binary-crossentropy loss function was leveraged along with the Nadam optimizer for this classification problem.

After 35 epochs the binary and validation classifiers reaches 98% and 97 accuracy, respectively, in predicting SMS spam.
